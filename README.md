# CEOS – Cognitive Ethical Operating System  

**Creator:** Maria Kollia  

## 🌍 Overview  
CEOS (Cognitive Ethical Operating System) is an innovative framework designed to integrate ethical and cognitive reasoning into Artificial Intelligence systems.  
It operates as an independent layer that “plugs into” existing AI architectures, enabling real-time detection, explanation, and mitigation of moral, social, and cognitive biases before model outputs are generated.  

## 🧠 Vision  
The goal of CEOS is to create **AI with conscience** — systems capable not only of reasoning and learning, but of aligning their decisions with human ethical principles and empathy.  

## ⚙️ How It Works  
CEOS connects to AI models as an embedded ethical module that performs:  
- Continuous bias detection and correction  
- Ethical decision mapping  
- Cognitive interpretation of user intent  
- Transparent justification of outputs  

## 💡 Applications  
- Responsible AI development and auditing  
- Research in AI ethics and philosophy of mind  
- Cognitive architecture enhancement  
- Educational and policy frameworks
